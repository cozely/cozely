Glam will be a minimalist framework for making games in Go, using 2D pixel art
or 3D polygonal art (aka low-poly).

## Work in Progress

**Not yet in a usable state**: the framework is *very* incomplete, and the API
is subject to frequent changes.

## Dependencies

The only dependancies are SDL 2 and OpenGL 4.5.

## License

The code is under a simplified BSD license (see LICENSE file). When a
sub-package is derived from another source, the directory contain the
appropriate LICENSE file.

## Credits

The Perlin and Simplex noise functions are adapted from ["Simplex Noise
Demystified"](http://www.itn.liu.se/~stegu/simplexnoise/simplexnoise.pdf) by
Stefan Gustavson (code in the public domain).

The pixel font was originally based on ["Pixel Operator
Mono"](https://notabug.org/HarvettFox96/ttf-pixeloperator) by Jayvee Enayas, but
has been so modified that it's now a completely different font. It is still
licensed under the SIL OFL.

Some implementations of the single-precision math functions are derived from the
[Go source code](https://github.com/golang/go) (BSD-style license).
