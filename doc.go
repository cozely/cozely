Package cozely is the starting point of the Cozely framework, a simple,
all-in-one set of packages for making games in Go.

WORK IN PROGRESS

The framework is *very* incomplete, and the API is subject to frequent changes.

The Framework

Both Windows and Linux are supported; there is only two dependencies (SDL2 and
OpenGL4.6).

Package input provides a way to handle user inputs with configurable bindings.

Package pixel provides a renderer dedicated to pixel art.

This package

The main focus of package cozely is to manage the game loop.
